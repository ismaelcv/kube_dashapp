# Build & Run docker image
```console
docker build -t dashapp_skeleton:latest .
docker run -p 8094:8094  dashapp_skeleton:latest
```



# To run the app in debug mode
```console
 export ENVIRONMENT=development
```



# ‚òÅ CDK deployment

In a new folder called infra run:
```
cdk init sample-app --language python 
```
The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

```
export AWS_ACCESS_REGION=$(aws --profile default configure get aws_region)
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.
```
cdk synth
cdk bootstraap
cdk deploy
cdk destroy
```
