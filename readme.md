# Repo Skeleton
This repository contains a barebone repository skeleton
The idea is that you can clone and rename this repo and start a new project with all the tools you need. The correct way of creating a private fotk by duplicating the repo is documented [here](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/). Following the next steps:


 1. Create a bare clone of the repository.
    (This is temporary and will be removed so just do it wherever.)
    ```bash
    git clone --bare git@github.com:source-ag/repo_skeleton.git
    ```

 2. Create a new private repository on Github and give it a good name, for example `my-project-repo`.

 3. Mirror-push your bare clone to your new `my-project-repo`.
    Replace your_username with your actual Github username in the url below.

    ```bash
    cd assignment-data-science
    git push --mirror git@github.com:ismaelcv/my-project-repo.git
    ```

 4. Remove the temporary local repository you created in step 1.
    ```bash
    cd ..
    rm -rf assignment-data-science
    ```

 5. You can now clone your repository on your machine.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/my-project-repo.git
    ```
